title: "Making a Cli Business Card"
---
A few days ago I saw [someone on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/m6w4g1/curlcard_a_cli_business_card_repost/) who made a cli business card. I thought it was pretty cool, so I decided to give it a go.
You can see my card by running the command <code>curl -sl flammableduck.xyz/card</code> You can make your own by creating a text file and uploading it to your website. Use [ANSI escape sequences](https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797) to make the text colored!
